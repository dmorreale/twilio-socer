    "Although there has been an overall positive growth in digital interactions across Twilio’s channels since the start of the pandemic, there was a decrease in the pace of that growth throughout 2021. This suggests that, after a year in which many consumers switched to digital interactions, fatigue has started to set in."

    "Electrolux managers found themselves responding to a painful one-two punch. First, a lightning bolt had struck their Malaysia-based contact center and disabled vital systems. Second, because of COVID-19, the government wouldn’t allow the century-old home-appliance manufacturer to send local technicians into the facility to make repairs. Shane Rose and his team reacted quickly: They issued a new toll-free customer support number and shifted the center’s operations to Twilio — all in less than 24 hours. Their fast thinking and Twilio’s technology enabled the contact center to remain operating with zero downtime. Shane described it as “A truly amazing effort.”"
