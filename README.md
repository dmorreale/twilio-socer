QA - ??



Todo:
	4 chart block:
		need a new image for the stripe background
		general edits to all of these charts
		make sure that the dot charts are pulling from the JSON
		drop-down is not working on pages 3 - 5
		center the charts

Outstanding chart issues:
    T2 - first bar chart - largest bar's label doesn't have padding
    T4 - Second bar chart needs styling
    T5 - radial chart is not left aligned and does not have a stroke. I don't know if these two are possible.

    minor:
    T1 - line chart - x-axis should start from the begining
	T5 - line chart needs to have the last x-axis label showing
	T3 - first bar chart - labels are not all aligned to the right

	


General:
	Padding needs to be adjusted after the charts are put in
		responsive as well but we have no design - will go off our gut and their suggestions
	Design does not cover small mobile screens < 375px - need to double check this screen on the site
	move styles from the spacings sass file to the layout sass file.
